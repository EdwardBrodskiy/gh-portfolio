          My name is Edvard Brodskiy I am currently studying Computer Science at Queen Mary
          University of London. My Interest in the subject began when I was first introduced to
          programing at the start of my Computer Science GCSE since then it has been a growing
          passion one of my first big projects was a an ai that learned to play a modified version
          of the game Snake this really started my interest for AI systems and has enhanced my
          interest in Computer Science as well as this I have written many smaller projects
          demonstrating mathematical phenomena such as certain outputs of the chaos game and polar
          equations all of which are visible on my GitHub account. However, my interest in Computer
          Science doesnâ€™t solely come from the prior mentioned topics but also from the maths I have
          done in school and how well it coincides with the fundamental algorithms in Computer
          Science. On the topic of my hobbies I have found my passion in fencing which I have
          enjoyed so much as to make it the main sport that I do at University.
